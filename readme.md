# `PRÃ–TÃ˜` - the simplest prototype Ã–Ã˜P in Lua

## Why?

It's no secret that there is a huge variety of different OOP libraries for Lua
and I'm even the author of one of them, but why did I think about writing
one more?

The fact is that no matter how lite and simple library is, it may somehow have
its own rules that the object-table must follow, and most often such tables are
modified (infected) with libraries, receiving various methods from them, without
which the table can not be considered object at all.

So I decided to write a library that treats absolutely any table as object.
It does not matter where this table came from, how it was created or what is
inside it. In fact, this library is just a set of auxiliary functions for
working with any tables in OOP style.

## General principles and terminology

Note that PRÃ–TÃ˜ uses a programming paradigm called [prototype programming][1].
The main difference between prototype-based and class-based OOP is that we
have no concept of Class.

It's very simple: instead of creating classes and their instances, we create an
ordinary table and specify its "relatives" using this library, which it will
refer to via the `__index` meta-method. In this case we call all tables as
tables instead of objects or classes, which in theory makes our life easier and
more pleasant ðŸ˜º.

Just as a table in lua combines an object and an array, we can also use the
generic term "slot" when talking about methods or fields, as long as we don't
focus on the type of variable.

For example: the `__index` metamethod is more correctly called **metaslot**,
because it can be both a function and a table.

Our tables have no library garbage, so they don't even have constructor
functions! Generally, constructors are not needed in prototype programming.

Instead of constructors, which creates and initializes the class instance,
and then returns it:

```lua
local Object = require "some.class-based.oop.library"

function Object:new(conf)
  self.super.init(self, conf)
  self.conf = conf or self.conf
  return self
end

local o = Object:new(conf)
```

I recommend just create empty table and initialize it:

```lua
local proto = require "proto"

local o = {}

function o:init(conf)
  local super = proto.get_tables(self, 2)[2]
  super.init(self, conf)
  self.conf = conf or self.conf
end

o:init(conf)

local another_o = proto({}, o)
another_o:init(conf)
```

## Arsenal

We have only 4 simple but powerful tools at our disposal:

+ `proto.link(t, ...)` or `proto(t, ...)`:
  multiple inheritance (linking tables via `__index`)
+ `proto.iter(t)` or `proto(t)`:
  iterator to try complex tables through a for loop
+ `proto.get_tables(t)`: get an array of all linked tables
+ `proto.merge_meta(t)`: metatable inheritance

For detailed API see [proto.lua](proto.lua),
examples in [example.lua](example.lua).

## Installation

`luarocks install proto`

Or download/clone the lua file/repository into your project,

## Caveats

This library is still very young and poorly covered by tests, so it can easily
have bugs, inaccuracies and defects, but at the same time it is pretty simple
and fix any bug is not very difficult. So if you find a bug or if you have any
idea how to improve it - feel free to create issues!
